This is 'Project:Recipes' was brought from 'theodinproject.com'
Made by John Nguyen :D

The website has a list of recipes, where you can learn and cook those delicious foods!
Each recipe gives a short description, needed ingredients, and steps to cook to get the desired results.

Skills used within project:

Using the Command Line Interface (CLI):
    1. Clone a Repo from Github using Git
    2. git add (filename) or . to add changes to a staging area
    3. git commit to create a snapshot of the staged changes, and save project history via version control
    4. git push to upload the local repo to a remote repo on Github

Using html5:
    Applied a boilerplate html to homepage and other files using this structure:
        <!DOCTYPE html> <!-- Using version: html5 -->
        <html lang="en"> <!-- html is using 'en' language to let screenreaders or browser-->
            <head>
                <meta charset="UTF-8"> <!-- lets us use special symbols within html file -->
                <title>meta data that browser displays on tab (aka Title)</title>
            </head>
            <body>
                <!-- 
                contents of an html file goes in here such as: 
                heading elements goes up to 6 from 1: <h1>,<h2>,...<h6>
                paragraphs: <p> displays block of text
                images: closes by itself, needs "src" attribute, and alt
                hyperlinks: <a> uses "href" attribute to link to files
                    we can link parents, children, siblings of each file using paths
                        .. goes into the parents directory
                        . is current directory
                lists such as <ol>, <ul>:
                    each needs <li>
                -->
            </body>
        </html>
